<h3>1. Long Live Rock 'N' Roll</h3>

All right<br>
Rock and roll, yeah<br>
<br>At the end of a dream<br>
If you know where I mean<br>
When the mist just starts to clear<br>
<br>In a similar way<br>
At the end of today<br>
I can feel the sound of writing on the wall<br>
It cries for you<br>
It's the least that you can do<br>
<br>Like a spiral on the wind<br>
I can hear it screamin' in my mind<br>
<br>Long live rock and roll<br>
Long live rock 'n' roll<br>
Long live rock and roll<br>
Let it live<br>
<br>In a different time<br>
When the words didn't rhyme<br>
You could never quite be sure<br>
Then on with the change<br>
It was simple but strange<br>
And you knew the feeling seemed to say it all<br>
It cries for you<br>
It's the least that you can do<br>
Like a spiral on the wind<br>
I can hear it screamin' in my mind<br>
<br>Long live rock and roll<br>
Long live rock 'n' roll<br>
Long live rock and roll<br>
I'm losing control<br>
<br>Long live rock and roll<br>
Long live rock 'n' roll, yeah<br>
Long live rock and roll<br>
Look you<br>
<br>If you suddenly see<br>
What has happened to me<br>
You should spread the word around<br>
<br>And tell everyone here<br>
That it is perfectly clear<br>
They can sail above it all on what they've found<br>
It cries for you<br>
It's the best that you can do<br>
Like a sound that's everywhere<br>
I can hear it screaming through the air<br>
<br>Long live rock and roll<br>
Long live rock 'n' roll<br>
Long live rock and roll<br>
Let it live, let it live, let it live<br>
<br>Long live rock and roll<br>
Long live rock 'n' roll, yeah<br>
Long live rock and roll<br>
<br>Banners held high with a curse and cry and it's<br>
Long live rock and roll<br>
Long live rock 'n' roll<br>
Long live rock and roll<br>
You feel it around, spread it around, make you what just should<br>
<br>Long live rock and roll<br>
Long live rock 'n' roll<br>
Long live rock and roll<br>
Live, live, live, live<br>
<br>Long live rock and roll<br>
Long live rock 'n' roll<br>
Long live rock and roll<br>
Let it live, let it live, let it live, let it live<br>
<br>Long live rock and roll<br>
Long live rock 'n' roll<br>
Long live rock and roll

<h3 class="s">2. Lady Of The Lake<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

There's a magical sound slidin' over the ground<br>
Makin' it shiver and shake<br>
And a permanent cry fallin' out of the sky<br>
Slippery and sly like a snake<br>
<br>With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth<br>
A shadow has covered the light<br>
Then a beam in the shade from a silvery blade<br>
Has shattered the edge of the night<br>
<br>I know she waits below<br>
Only to rise on command<br>
When she comes for me<br>
She's got my life in her hands<br>
<br>When a movement behind hit the side of my mind<br>
I trembled and shook it away<br>
Then another assault and I started to faulter<br>
Fibres of steel turned to clay<br>
<br>With a bubbly turn now the water should churn<br>
And push it way from the core<br>
And a lady in white will bring sun to the night<br>
Brighter than ever before<br>
<br>I know she waits below<br>
Only to rise on command<br>
When she comes for me<br>
She's got my life in her hands<br>
Lady of the lake<br>
<br>There's a magical sound slidin' over the ground<br>
Makin' it shiver and shake<br>
And a permanent cry fallin' out of the sky<br>
Slippery and sly like a snake<br>
<br>With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth<br>
A shadow has covered the light<br>
Then a beam in the shade from a slivery blade<br>
Has shattered the edge of the night<br>
<br>Straight down I'm swirling around<br>
Blinded and bruised by the strain<br>
There must be some way to see<br>
Diamonds out of the rain<br>
<br>I know she waits below<br>
Only to rise on command<br>
When she comes for me<br>
She's got my life in her hands<br>
Lady of the lake

<h3 class="s">3. L.A. Connection<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

Oh, carry home my broken bones and lay me down to rest<br>
Forty days of cries and moans I guess<br>
I've failed to pass the test<br>
I've been sent away not a thing to say<br>
I'm banished from the fold<br>
I'm a fallen angel who's lost his wings and left out in the cold<br>
<br>Ooooh L.A. connection<br>
Oh L.A. connection<br>
L.A. connection, yeah<br>
<br>Operator place a call keep secret but it through<br>
Investigator knows it all he's at the window I wonder who<br>
I've got to cut the line and let me drift find a haven in the storm<br>
I got no time I need a lift to where it's sweet and close and warm<br>
<br>I say<br>
Ooooh L.A. connection<br>
Oh L.A. connection<br>
L.A. connection<br>
<br>Hey, carry home my broken bones and lay me down to rest<br>
Forty days of cries and moans well I've just failed the test<br>
Feel I'm balanced on the brim should I lean another way<br>
Like a flame that's going on the dim needs blessing from the day, oh<br>
<br>Ooooh L.A. connection, L.A. connection<br>
Oh take me away I got nothing to say<br>
It's got to be an L.A. connection, oh<br>
Ooooh L.A. connection, L.A. connection<br>
<br>Ooooh, L.A., L.A., L.A., L.A., L.A. connection<br>

Oh, L.A. connection, L.A. connection<br>

<h3 class="s">4. Gates Of Babylon<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

Look away from the sea<br>
I can take you anywhere<br>
Spend a vision with me<br>
A chase with the wind<br>
<br>Move closer to me<br>
I can make you anyone<br>
I think you're ready to see<br>
The gates of Babylon<br>
<br>The power of what has been before<br>
Rises to trap you within<br>
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more<br>
A city of heavenly sin<br>
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay<br>
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away<br>
Oh gates of Babylon<br>
<br>You can see but you're blind<br>
Someone turned the sun around<br>
But you can see in your mind<br>
The gates of Babylon<br>
<br>You're riding the endless caravan<br>
Bonded and sold as a slave<br>
A sabre dance removing all the veils<br>
Getting as good as you gave<br>
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay<br>
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away<br>
<br>Look away from the sea<br>
I can take you anywhere<br>
Spend a vision with me<br>
A chase with the wind<br>
<br>Move closer to me<br>
I can make you anyone<br>
I think you're ready to see<br>
The gates of Babylon<br>
<br>The power of what has been before<br>
Rises to trap you within<br>
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more<br>
A city of heavenly sin<br>
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay<br>
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away<br>
Black gates of Babylon<br>
<br>The devil is me<br>
And I'm holding the key<br>
To the gates of sweet hell<br>
Babylon

Danger, danger the Queen's about to kill<br>

I'm like a freight train<br>
Feelin' no pain<br>
I never turn back one track<br>
Better step aside<br>
<br>Like a shotgun<br>
I'm really someone<br>
You'll feel my heatwave<br>
Won't save anyone near to me<br>
<br>I'm steel<br>
So come and try to bend me if you can, hah<br>
I don't feel<br>
Before you know it it's over<br>
Get out of my way<br>
I'm street walking, street walking<br>
Night stalking, I'm street walking<br>
<br>No reputation<br>
You better quick run<br>
Cause I got no time I'll climb<br>
All over you<br>
<br>You need a strong hand<br>
To be a mean man<br>
You've got to think fast<br>
I'll last longer than you could know<br>
<br>I'm steel<br>
So won't you come and try to bend me if you can<br>
I don't feel<br>
Before you know it it's over<br>
Out of my way<br>
I'm street walking<br>
<br>Hey, I'm a wild cat<br>
Don't need to prove that<br>
I'm always howlin' prowlin'<br>
Stalkin' my prey<br>
<br>It could be your night<br>
To feel the dog bite<br>
And hear the slashing, crashin'<br>
Tearin' inside of you<br>
<br>I'm steel<br>
So come and try to break me if you can, no way<br>
Like a wheel<br>
About to roll you over<br>
Get out of my way<br>
I'm street walkin', street walkin'<br>
No talkin', street walking<br>
Night stalking, street walking<br>
No talkin', I'm street walkin', yeah<br>
Street walkin', street walkin'<br>
Night stalking, street walking

<h3 class="s">7. Sensitive To Light<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

I was feelin' rather good<br>
Should've touched some wood<br>
Here she comes again<br>
Reachin' out to bend my ear<br>
<br>She's worth another look<br>
All the time it took<br>
Pleasin' to the eye<br>
How can I just disappear, oh<br>
It ain't clear, no<br>
She's a bright and shining star<br>
But I just must be sensitive to light<br>
Oh I just might, yeah<br>
<br>I could have let her in<br>
Give her just a spin<br>
Let her think it's love<br>
Better rise above it all<br>
<br>She's knockin' at the door<br>
Seems to want some more<br>
Never gets the clue<br>
What am I to do she'll fall<br>
And she might call, oh no<br>
She's a bright and shining star<br>
But I just must be sensitive to light<br>
Oh, I just know<br>
<br>She could do me well<br>
I can always tell<br>
She's ready for the kill<br>
But I think that I will go, no<br>
<br>Sure I'm gonna see<br>
Something just for me<br>
Till it comes along<br>
When it's feelin' wrong I'll know<br>
Gotta take it slow, yeah<br>
<br>She's a bright and shining star<br>
But I just must be sensitive to light<br>
Oh, I might, yeah<br>
<br>She's a bright and blazing star<br>
But I just must be sensitive to light, yeah<br>
Sensitive to light, Ooooh

She's been gone since yesterday<br>
Oh I didn't care<br>
Never cared for yesterdays<br>
Fancies in the air<br>
<br>No sighs or mysteries<br>
She lay golden in the sun<br>
No broken harmonies<br>
But I've lost my way<br>
She had rainbow eyes<br>
Rainbow eyes<br>
Rainbow eyes<br>
<br>Love should be a simple blend<br>
A whispering on the shore<br>
No clever words you can't defend<br>
They lead to never more<br>
<br>No sighs or mysteries<br>
She lay golden in the sun<br>
No broken harmonies<br>
But I've lost my way<br>
She had rainbow eyes<br>
Rainbow eyes<br>
Rainbow eyes<br>
<br>Summer nights are colder now<br>
They've taken down the fair<br>
All the lights have died somehow<br>
Or were they ever there<br>
<br>No sighs or mysteries<br>
She lay golden in the sun<br>
No broken harmonies<br>
But I've lost my way<br>
She had rainbow eyes<br>
<br>Oooh, ooh
