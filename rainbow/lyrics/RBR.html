<h3>1. Man On The Silver Mountain</h3>

I'm a wheel, I'm a wheel<br>
I can roll, I can feel<br>
And you can't stop me turning<br>
<br>
Cause I'm the sun, I'm the sun<br>
I can move, I can run<br>
But you'll never stop me burning<br>
<br>
Come down with fire<br>
Lift my spirit higher<br>
Someone's screaming my name<br>
Come and make me holy again<br>
<br>
I'm the man on the silver mountain<br>
I'm the man on the silver mountain<br>
<br>
I'm the day, I'm the day<br>
I can show you the way<br>
And look, I'm right beside you<br>
<br>
I'm the night, I'm the night<br>
I'm the dark and the light<br>
With eyes that see inside you<br>
<br>
Come down with fire<br>
Lift my spirit higher<br>
Someone's screaming my name<br>
Come and make me holy again<br>
<br>
I'm the man on the silver mountain<br>
I'm the man on the silver mountain<br>
<br>
Come down with fire<br>
And lift my spirit higher<br>
Someone's screaming my name<br>
Come and make me holy again<br>
<br>
Well, I can help you, you know I can<br>
<br>
I'm the man on the silver mountain<br>
I'm the man on the silver mountain<br>
<br>
Just look at me and listen<br>
I'm the man, the man, give you my hand<br>
I'm the man on the silver mountain<br>
<br>
Come down with fire<br>
And lift your spirit higher<br>
I'm the man on the mountain<br>
The man on the silver mountain<br>
I'm the night, the light<br>
The black and the white<br>
The man on the silver mountain

<h3 class="s">2. Self Portrait<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

Paint me your picture and hang it on the wall<br>
Color it darkly, the lines must start to crawl<br>
<br>
Down, down, down<br>
Spin me around and around<br>
Draw me away to the night from the day<br>
Leave not a trace to be found<br>
Down, down<br>
<br>
Nothing is real but the way that I feel<br>
And I feel like going down, down, down, down<br>
Down, down, down, down, down<br>
<br>
Paint me a picture of eyes that never see<br>
With flashes of lightning that burn for only me<br>
<br>
Hey hey hey<br>
There's only the devil to pay<br>
I'm ready to go<br>
Pull me down from below<br>
Give me a place I can lay<br>
<br>Hey hey<br>
Nothing is real but the way that I feel<br>
I feel like going down, down, down, down<br>
Down, down, down, down<br>
<br>Hey hey<br>
Nothing is real but the way that I feel<br>
And I feel like going down<br>
Down, down<br>
<br>Nothing is real but the way that I feel<br>
And I feel like going down, down, down, down<br>
Down, down, down, down<br>
Down, down, down, down<br>
Down

<h3 class="s">3. Black Sheep Of The Family<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

I've got nothing in my head<br>
Got a floor for a bed<br>
The future's at the bottom of a tea cup<br>
<br>I got a half a pair of shoes<br>
And no time to lose<br>
I'm wondering when I'm going to wise up<br>
<br>So, fortune shine your light on me and my clothes<br>
Cause we need some security<br>
You get a little bad luck<br>
And it grows and it grows<br>
I'm the black sheep of the family<br>
<br>I've got half a pound of rice<br>
A beard full of lice<br>
A mission called retrogression<br>
<br>I've got pocket full of dust<br>
And eating is a must<br>
You want to make a good impression<br>
<br>So, fortune shine your light on me and my dog<br>
Cause we need some security<br>
While all the folks are living high up the hill<br>
I'm the black sheep of the family<br>
<br>Don't talk to me about society<br>
You got to pay the rules<br>
Or pay the penalty<br>
<br>Because there's nothing to choose<br>
Between a handful of blues<br>
Double indemnity<br>
<br>The hour was wrong<br>
And my shadow's getting long<br>
My real life's a song, don't need much<br>
But I've got an ache in my head<br>
I wanna go to bed<br>
Tomorrow I don't have to wake up, no<br>
<br>So wisdom shine your light on me and my knees<br>
Cause it's true what they say about familiarity<br>
There's nothing good this way<br>
And it's true they say<br>
I'm the black sheep of the family<br>
<br>Oh, my wisdom shine your light on me and my knees<br>
It's true what they say about familiarity<br>
There's nothing good this way<br>
And it's true they say<br>
I'm the black sheep of the family<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
<br>I'm the black sheep of the family<br>
Just me and my dog, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm the black sheep of the family<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm the black sheep of the family<br>
You've got me on my knees<br>
I'm the black sheep of the family<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah

<h3 class="s">4. Catch The Rainbow<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

When evening falls<br>
She'll run to me<br>
Like whispered dreams<br>
Your eyes can't see<br>
<br>Soft and warm<br>
She'll touch my face<br>
A bed of straw<br>
Against the lace<br>
<br>We believed we'd catch the rainbow<br>
Ride the wind to the sun<br>
Sail away on ships of wonder<br>
<br>But life's not a wheel<br>
With chains made of steel<br>
So bless me<br>
<br>Come the dawn<br>
Come the dawn<br>
Come the dawn<br>
Come the dawn<br>
<br>We believed we'd catch the rainbow<br>
Ride the wind to the sun<br>
And sail away on ships of wonder<br>
<br>But life's not a wheel<br>
With chains made of steel<br>
So bless me, oh bless me, bless me<br>
<br>Come the dawn<br>
Come the dawn<br>
Come the dawn<br>
Come the dawn

Old hollow eyes<br>

To beware you don't care<br>

And tell you lies<br>

No hope for you, ooh<br>

<h3 class="s">6. The Temple Of The King<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

One day in the year of the fox<br>
Came a time remembered well<br>
When the strong young man of the rising sun<br>
Heard the tolling of the great black bell<br>
<br>One day in the year of the fox<br>
When the bell began to ring<br>
Meant the time had cometh<br>
For one to go<br>
To the temple of the king<br>
<br>There in the middle of the circle he stands<br>
Searching, seeking<br>
With just one touch of his trembling hand<br>
The answer will be found<br>
<br>Daylight waits while the old man sings<br>
Heaven help me<br>
And then like the rush of a thousand wings<br>
It shines upon the one<br>
And the day had just begun<br>
<br>One day in the year of the fox<br>
Came a time remembered well<br>
When the strong young man of the rising sun<br>
Heard the tolling of the great black bell<br>
<br>One day in the year of the fox<br>
When the bell began to sing<br>
It meant the time had cometh<br>
For one to go<br>
To the temple of the king<br>
<br>There in the middle of the people<br>
He stands<br>
Seeing, feeling<br>
With just a wave of a strong right hand<br>
He's gone<br>
To the temple of the king<br>
<br>Far from the circle at the edge of the world<br>
He's hoping, wondering<br>
Thinking back from the stories he's heard<br>
Of what he's going to see<br>
<br>There in middle of the circle it lies<br>
Heaven help me<br>
Then all could see by the shine in his eyes<br>
The answer had been found<br>
<br>Back with the people in the circle<br>
He stands<br>
Giving, feeling<br>
With just one touch of a strong right hand<br>
They know<br>
Of the temple and the king<br>

<h3 class="s">7. If You Don't Like Rock 'N' Roll<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

You'd never know there was some music playin'<br>
Until you talked your way inside the door<br>
<br>And then a sound like rollin' thunder<br>
Begins to push you right thru the floor<br>
<br>And there's a great white sign<br>
With big black letters<br>
That just about explains it all<br>
<br>If you don't like rock 'n' roll<br>
Well, if you don't like rock 'n' roll<br>
If you don't like rock 'n' roll<br>
Then it's too late now<br>
Well it's too late now<br>
<br>Hey hey<br>
Of course there was the usual lady<br>
And she was dressed the way the stories tell<br>
<br>So bein' cool I made a move to grab her<br>
But you could see she read story well<br>
<br>And then she whipped out a card<br>
With big black letters<br>
<br>That just about explained it all<br>
Well if you don't like rock 'n' roll<br>
If you don't like rock 'n' roll<br>
Well if you don't like rock 'n' roll<br>
Then you're too late now<br>
Then you're too late now<br>
<br>Well, if you don't like rock 'n' roll<br>
Well, if you don't like rock 'n' roll, yeah<br>
If you don't like rock 'n' roll<br>
Well it's too late nown<br>
You're too late now<br>
<br>If you don't like rock 'n' roll<br>
If you don't like my rock 'n' roll<br>
Then you're too late now<br>
Then you're too late now<br>
Then you're too late, too late now<br>

<h3 class="s">8. Sixteenth Century Greensleeves<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

It's only been an hour<br>
Since he locked her in the tower<br>
The time has come<br>
He must be undone<br>
By the morning<br>
<br>Many times before<br>
The tyrant's opened up the door<br>
Then someone cries<br>
Still we close our eyes<br>
Not again<br>
<br>Meet me when the sun is in the western skies<br>
The fighting must begin before another someone dies<br>
Cross bows in the fire light<br>
Green sleeves waving<br>
Madmen raving<br>
Through the shattered night<br>
Yeah yeah yeah<br>
<br>Flames are getting higher<br>
Make it leap unto the spire<br>
Draw bridge down<br>
Cut it to the ground<br>
We shall dance around the fire<br>
<br>No more night<br>
We have seen the light<br>
Let it shine on bright<br>
Hang him higher, higher<br>
<br>Draw bridge down<br>
Cut it to the ground<br>
We shall dance all around the fire, around the fire<br>
<br>No more night<br>
we've seen the light<br>
let it shine on bright<br>
<br>Hang him higher, higher<br>
Put the man on the fire<br>
<br>Draw bridge down<br>
Cut it to the ground<br>
We gotta dance around the fire, the fire, the fire
