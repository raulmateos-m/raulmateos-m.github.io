<h3>1. Tarot Woman</h3>

I don't wanna go<br>
Something tells me no, no, no, no<br>
But traces in the sand<br>
The lines inside my hand<br>
Say go, go, go<br>
<br>Beware of a place<br>
A smile of a pride shiny face<br>
<br>I'll never return up to your love<br>
Tarot woman<br>
I don't know<br>
I don't know<br>
<br>She can take you there<br>
The answer's to the fear<br>
Mine, mine, mine<br>
<br>Like a carousel<br>
And cast a magic spell<br>
You can fly, fly<br>
<br>Beware of a place<br>
A smile of a pride shining face<br>
<br>I'll never return up to your love<br>
Tarot woman but I don't know<br>
I don't know<br>
I don't know<br>
I don't know<br>
<br>Something in the air<br>
Tells me to beware, no, no, no<br>
Her love is like a knife<br>
Should cut away your life<br>
So go, go, go<br>
<br>Beware of a place<br>
A smile of a pride shining face<br>
<br>I'll never return up to your love<br>
Tarot woman, I don't know<br>
I don't know<br>
I don't know<br>
Hey, I don't know

<h3 class="s">2. Run With The Wolf<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

In the light of the day<br>
You can hear the old one say<br>
Was the sound last night the wind<br>
Can you feel the change begin<br>
<br>By the fall of the snow<br>
A single soul will go<br>
The footsteps on the white<br>
There's an unholy light<br>
<br>There's a hole in the sky<br>
Something evil's passing by<br>
What's to come - when the siren calls you go<br>
To run with the wolf<br>
<br>When the world makes a turn<br>
The eyes of one will learn<br>
That the sound just like the wind<br>
Only makes the change begin<br>
<br>By the end of the rain<br>
The feelings passed again<br>
And things that snapped and bited<br>
Unholy light<br>
<br>There's a hole in the sky<br>
Something evil's passing by<br>
What's to come - when the siren calls you go<br>
To run with the wolf<br>
<br>There's a break in the ground<br>
Like the swirling water's angry as they pull you down<br>
<br>When the siren calls you go, yeah<br>
To run with the wolf<br>
Run with the wolf<br>
<br>There's a hole in the sky<br>
Something evil is passing by<br>
What's to come - when the siren calls you go, yeah<br>
To run with the wolf<br>
Run with the wolf<br>
<br>Like a beast in a field<br>
You know just it pays in steel<br>
You run with the wolf, oh oooh<br>
<br>Run with the wolf<br>
<br>See the break, you know it's the same<br>
Now we go<br>
To run, run, run<br>
Run, run, run, run<br>
<br>Run with the wolf<br>
Run with the wolf<br>
Run with the wolf<br>
Run with the wolf<br>
Run, run, run<br>
Now we go run, run, run, run<br>
Run with the wolf<br>
All right<br>
Run with the wolf<br>
Run with the wolf<br>

If I'm high on the hill<br>
She'd still been looking down at me<br>
What does she see that brings her closer every day to my heart<br>
If I'm away from home<br>
And think I'm all alone<br>
She's there, somewhere<br>
I look around and see<br>
And looking back at me<br>
She's there, beware!<br>
<br>Creeping like a hungry cat<br>
I've seen her before<br>
I know it can mean that<br>
<br>The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck<br>
The lady starstruck, running after me<br>
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, yeah<br>
<br>I could fly to the moon<br>
But she soon find me and wait me there<br>
I never knew for a while as smile made me really care<br>
<br>She wants a souvenir<br>
To everyone it's clear<br>
She's hot, hot - hot, hot, one look<br>
She want a photograph<br>
But everybody laughs but not me 'cause I see<br>
<br>She's creeping like a hungry cat<br>
I've seen her before<br>
I know I can mean that<br>
<br>The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck<br>
The lady starstruck, running after me<br>
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, oh oh o-o-oh<br>
Oh my<br>
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck<br>
The lady starstruck, running after me, yeah<br>
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, yeah<br>
<br>It used to be a game<br>
Now I can't repeat my name at all<br>
She seems to believe that<br>
I never can refuse a call<br>
<br>She wants a souvenir<br>
To everyone it's clear<br>
She's hot; one look<br>
She want a photograph<br>
And everybody laughs, hah!<br>
But not me 'cause I see<br>
<br>She's creeping like a hungry cat<br>
I've seen her before<br>
I know it can mean that<br>
<br>The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck<br>
The lady starstruck, running after me<br>
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, bad luck<br>
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck<br>
<br>The lady starstruck running after me<br>
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck<br>
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck<br>
And back in the tree looking back at me<br>
Climbing up my stair<br>
I've just got to beware<br>
Lady starstruck, yes, she's bad luck, bad luck

<h3 class="s">4. Do You Close Your Eyes<a href="#toc"> <i class="icon-long-arrow-up"></i></a></h3>

Oh na na na na<br>
Mystery in me is something I can't see<br>
But I see you very well<br>
You slippy, cool, nobody's fool<br>
But there's something inside I can't tell<br>
<br>I know a poor man, a rich man<br>
I know I can talk to a king<br>
But nobody here is gonna tell me<br>
I can't find out one thing<br>
<br>I see your glow around you<br>
Open your arms 'cause I'm walking to you, come straight or through<br>
Maybe I'm wrong but I know it won't take long to see<br>
Do you close your eyes<br>
Do you close your eyes<br>
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah, yeah<br>
Making sweet love to me, yeah<br>
<br>The logical friend said that I know in the end<br>
The things that make me smile<br>
To right from the start, I take the image of your heart<br>
and know it all the while<br>
<br>I know a rich man, a poor man<br>
I know I can talk to a king, yeah<br>
So nobody here is gonna make me believe<br>
I can't find out one thing<br>
<br>I see your glow around you<br>
Open your arms 'cause I'm coming, running, straight or through<br>
I could be wrong but I know it won't take long to see<br>
Do you close your eyes<br>
Do you close your eyes<br>
Do you close your eyes when you making love, yeah<br>
<br>Do you close your eyes<br>
Do you close your eyes, I've gotta know<br>
Do you close your eyes when you making love

High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water<br>
Nine years worth of breakin' my back<br>
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard<br>
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air?<br>
Oh I see his face!<br>
<br>Where is your star?<br>
Is it far, is it far, is it far?<br>
When do we leave?<br>
I believe, yes, I believe<br>
<br>In the heat and the rain<br>
With the whips and chains<br>
To see him fly<br>
So many die<br>
We built a tower of stone<br>
With our flesh and bone<br>
Just to see him fly<br>
But don't know why<br>
Now where do we go?<br>
<br>Hot wind, moving fast across the desert<br>
We feel that our time has arrived<br>
The world spins, while we put his dream together<br>
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky<br>
Oh I see his face!<br>
<br>Where is your star?<br>
Is it far, is it far, is it far?<br>
When do we leave?<br>
Hey, I believe, I believe<br>
<br>In the heat and the rain<br>
With the whips and chains<br>
Just to see him fly<br>
Too many die<br>
We built a tower of stone<br>
With our flesh and bone<br>
To see him fly<br>
But we don't know why<br>
Ooh, now where do we go<br>
<br>All eyes see the figure of the wizard<br>
As he climbs to the top of the world<br>
No sound, as he falls instead of rising<br>
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand<br>
Oh I see his face!<br>
<br>Where was your star?<br>
Was it far, was it far<br>
When did we leave?<br>
We believed, we believed, we believed<br>
<br>In heat and rain<br>
With the whips and chains<br>
To see him fly<br>
So many died<br>
We built a tower of stone<br>
With our flesh and bone<br>
To see him fly<br>
<br>But why<br>
In all the rain<br>
With all the chains<br>
Did so many die<br>
Just to see him fly<br>
<br>Look at my flesh and bone<br>
Now, look, look, look, look,<br>
Look at the tower of stone<br>
I see your rainbow rising<br>
Look there, on the horizon oh no, who's rising<br>
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home<br>
<br>Time is standing still<br>
You, give back my will<br>
Ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
Going home<br>
I'm going home<br>
<br>My eyes are bleeding<br>
And my heart is lead ahead<br>
But it's not home<br>
But it's not home<br>
Ooh<br>
<br>Take me back<br>
You, give me back my will<br>
Ooh ooh ooh ooh<br>
<br>Going home<br>
I'm going home<br>
<br>My eyes are bleeding<br>
And my heart is lead ahead<br>
But it's not home<br>
But it's not home<br>
<br>Take me back, take me back<br>
Back to my home ooh, ooh, ooh

Can't forget his face<br>
What a lonely place<br>
Has he really let us go?<br>
<br>All the time that's lost<br>
What's the final cost<br>
Will I really get away?<br>
<br>All my life it seems<br>
Just a crazy dream<br>
Reaching for somebody's star<br>
<br>Can't believe it all<br>
Did he really fall<br>
What to do now I don't know<br>
<br>Something's called me back<br>
There's a light in the black<br>
and I&acute;m ready to go<br>
I'm coming home<br>
<br>Breathed the air before<br>
Hear the thunder roar<br>
Never knew it was for me<br>
<br>Always looking down<br>
Lost and never found<br>
Eyes that look but not to see<br>
<br>All my life it seems<br>
Just a crazy dream<br>
Reaching for somebody's star<br>
<br>Like an open door<br>
That you passed before<br>
But you never had a key<br>
<br>Something's called me back<br>
There's a light in the black<br>
<br>I'm coming home, I'm coming home, yeah<br>
I'm going back to my home<br>
<br>I'm going home, home, home<br>
Going home, home, home<br>
I'm coming back<br>
<br>Don't forget his face<br>
What a lonely place<br>
Did he really let us go<br>
<br>All the time that's lost<br>
What's the final cost<br>
Will I really get away?<br>
<br>All my life it seems<br>
Just a crazy dream<br>
Reaching for somebody's star<br>
<br>Can't believe it all<br>
Did he really fall<br>
What to do now, well I don't know<br>
<br>Something's called me back<br>
Like a light in the black<br>
Yes, I&acute;m ready to go<br>
I'm coming home, home, yeah<br>
<br>I've got my way back home<br>
To the sky<br>
There in the sky<br>
I see your star
